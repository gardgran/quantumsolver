Shor's Algorithm Quantum Solver

This is a quantum solver simulation for shor's algorthim.
The quantum simulation is done during the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) to find the period.
Once the period is found. The factors of N are classically solved.

The quantum simulation only works (in a reasonable time frame) for small numbers ( < 7 bits). 
Above that, the program will not attempt to run.
